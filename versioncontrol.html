	<h2>Version Control System</h2><br>

	    <p  class="cp1 "> 
       	    	Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. For the examples in this book, you will use software source code as the files being version controlled, though in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer. If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.

<p> <h3 >Fork</h3>A fork is a copy of a repository.Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project</p>
<h3> Commit</h3>
<p>The git commit command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be thought of as "safe" version of a project. Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to.
<br>Using the "git committ" command only saves a new commit object in the local git repositry.  </p>
<h3 >Push</h3>
<p>The push command can be considered as a toll to transfer commits between local and remote repositories. It is used to publish new local commits on a remote server.</p>
